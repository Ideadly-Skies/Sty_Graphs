# Sty_Graphs
A repository for all of the lectures and exercises pertaining graphs.

### note from Alvin the creator
as we are recovering these brand new topics and concepts in the graph
topics, it's consolidating your knowledge in binary trees. The thing you
need to study is the thing you're uncomfortable with.

Feel free to review the concepts we have touched on previously. We're going to
be increasing the difficulty so keep doing what you're doing.
